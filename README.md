## Game Rules & Mechanics

### Texas Hold'em Rules

This implementation follows standard Texas Hold'em poker rules:

1. **Blinds**: Small blind and big blind are posted before each hand
2. **Betting Rounds**:
   - **Pre-flop**: After receiving 2 hole cards
   - **Flop**: After 3 community cards are dealt
   - **Turn**: After 4th community card
   - **River**: After 5th community card
3. **Actions Available**:
   - **Fold**: Discard hand and forfeit pot
   - **Check**: Pass action (when no bet to call)
   - **Call**: Match the current bet
   - **Raise**: Increase the bet amount
4. **Showdown**: Best 5-card hand wins (using 2 hole cards + 5 community cards)
5. **Side Pots**: Automatically calculated when players go all-in

### Game Flow

1. Players join a table and sit down
2. When 2+ players are seated, a new hand starts automatically
3. Blinds are posted, cards are dealt
4. Betting rounds proceed (pre-flop → flop → turn → river)
5. Showdown determines winner(s)
6. Chips are distributed
7. New hand begins after 5 seconds
